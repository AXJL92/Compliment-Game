The **Compliment Tracker** is a small web-based app that lets users log compliments they've given or received.  

It's built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and runs entirely in your browser — no downloads or logins required.


This app is entirely front-end, so nothing is stored on a server.

It’s designed for personal use or as a mini project.

You can edit the design or code freely to customise it.
