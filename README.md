The Compliment Tracker is a small web-based app that allows users to log compliments they've given or received. It’s designed to encourage positivity and reflection by keeping a running list of kind words.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it works right in your browser – no login or downloads required.


This app is entirely front-end, so nothing is stored on a server.

It’s designed for personal use or as a mini project.

You can edit the design or code freely to customise it.
